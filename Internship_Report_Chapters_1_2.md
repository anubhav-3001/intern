## 2.4 Current Projects (Context of Internship)

### AntiFraud Project - Financial Fraud Detection

This internship was conducted under the "Financial Security and Anomaly Detection" research cluster of the CoE.

**Project Context:**
Financial fraud is a growing concern in the digital economy. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to detect complex, networked fraud patterns. This project leverages **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to model entities (users, transactions) as graphs, enabling the detection of suspicious relationships and patterns that are invisible to standard analysis.

**Project Alignment:**
This project aligns with the CoE's mission of "Cognitive Intelligent Systems" by creating a system that *learns* and *adapts* to new fraud tactics, rather than relying on static rules.

**Key Contributions during Internship:**
- **Algorithm Development:** Implementation of GATE-Net, GAP-Net, and STRA-GNN models.
- **Platform Integration:** Utilizing the CoE's computational resources for training complex GNNs.
- **Tool Creation:** Developing a Streamlit-based dashboard for interactive fraud analysis, making the research accessible to non-experts.
