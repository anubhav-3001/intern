# ANNEXURE – I

## INTERNSHIP TIMELINE (6 WEEKS)

**Week 1**  
Orientation to the Centre of Excellence in Cognitive Intelligent Systems for Sustainable Solutions (CISSS). Understanding internship objectives, problem statement, and the role of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in financial security. Setting up the development environment (PyTorch, DGL) and introduction to the HPCC Systems Big Data platform.

**Week 2**  
Literature review on Graph Neural Networks for fraud detection, focusing on temporal patterns and semi-supervised learning. Analysis of the Financial Fraud Dataset (S-FFSD) structure. Implementation of initial data preprocessing pipelines to handle raw transaction logs and label encoding.

**Week 3**  
Advanced feature engineering. Development of algorithms to generate 2D temporal feature matrices and "Neighbor Risk-Aware" statistics. Design of graph construction logic to model transactions as nodes connected by shared attributes (User, Location, Device).

**Week 4**  
Implementation of the GATE-Net (Graph Attention Temporal Embedding Network) architecture. Development of 2D CNN layers for temporal pattern extraction and integration with Graph Convolutional layers. Initial model testing and debugging of tensor shapes.

**Week 5**  
Implementation and refinement of GAP-Net (Gated Attention & Propagation Network) and STRA-GNN (Structural-Temporal Risk Attention GNN). Coding of complex attention mechanisms (TransformerConv, Label Propagation). rigorous model training, hyperparameter tuning, and benchmarking using AUC-ROC metrics.

**Week 6**  
Development of the interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time inference and visualization. Integration of risk gauges and model comparison tools. Final documentation of model architectures, code refactoring, and submission of the internship report.
