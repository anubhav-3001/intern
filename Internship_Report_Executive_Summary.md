**Duration:** 6 Weeks

In the evolving landscape of digital finance, fraudulent activities have become increasingly sophisticated, often evading detection by traditional rule-based systems. This internship project, conducted under the **HPCC Systems Centre of Excellence**, addresses this challenge by developing a next-generation fraud detection framework utilizing **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**. The core philosophy driving this work is that fraud is a networked phenomenon; therefore, analyzing relationships between entities is as crucial as analyzing isolated transactions. The primary objective was to design, implement, and evaluate advanced deep learning architectures capable of detecting anomalies in semi-supervised financial datasets. Specific goals included developing feature engineering pipelines to extract temporal behavioral patterns, extending graph-based risk statistics, implementing three distinct GNN architectures, and creating an interactive dashboard to translate complex model outputs into actionable insights for fraud analysts.

The project utilized a **financial fraud dataset** to model varying fraud scenarios. The technical approach involved advanced feature engineering to transform raw transaction logs into rich feature sets, including **2D temporal matrices** for sequential behavior and **Risk-aware Neighbor Statistics** for quantifying network risk. By modeling transactions as nodes in a graph connected by shared attributes like User ID or Location, the system traces complex money flows. Three specific algorithms were implemented: **GATE-Net**, utilizing 2D CNNs for temporal patterns; **GAP-Net**, a semi-supervised model using Graph Transformer Convolutions; and **STRA-GNN**, an enhanced transformer model integrating neighbor risk statistics.

All three models were successfully implemented and benchmarked, with the **STRA-GNN** model emerging as the top performer, achieving an **AUC-ROC of 0.8461** and an **F1-Score of 0.7513**. This validates the hypothesis that explicitly modeling neighborhood risk significantly enhances detection capabilities. Key deliverables include a fully functional **Python/Pytorch codebase** using DGL, a comprehensive **technical documentation**, and an interactive **Streamlit Dashboard** for real-time inference and visualization.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the efficacy of Graph Neural Networks in identifying complex financial fraud. By moving beyond isolated transaction analysis to a holistic, graph-based view, the framework provides a robust solution for modern financial security. This work aligns with the CoE’s mission to create intelligent, sustainable systems, laying a strong foundation for future research in anomaly detection.
